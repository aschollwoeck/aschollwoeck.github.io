Hello dear readers,

we continue writing two days later, seems like we got a bit of motivation left for today evening and we can be still be a bit productive.

## Weekly plan
I'm still on a good way of my weekly plan for more productivty - even so yesterday I did not continue with my workout... Muscles are so sore that it was not possible to do so, at least not with my plan on doing additional burpees. Additionally I went out to have dinner with my family, so let's wait until the weekend and continue then with my workout, maybe 100 burpees are then possible at least over the whole day instead of doing them within 30 minutes.

## Next
I'm plan on doing a write up the next couple of days of a project of mine regarding C# and SQL. I favor wrting SQL myself but I want to have some verifications in my code. In C# I want the compiler to do the job for me. This way we pay a price up front and spending some micro or milliseconds of compute power for the compiler but we are sure to be type safe and we can get ride of a whole category of potential problems.

We won't get the same performance as writing static strings in our code but it's fine if we pay 1 additional millisecond per request. We might even be able to get rid of some of the introduced overhead when looking at the new code generation feature in .NET 6 - let's find out.


See you next time with a more technical write-up instead of talking about my personal life.
